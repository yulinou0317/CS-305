# CS 305 Project 1

#Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Our client, Artemis Financial, is a consulting company that construct customized financial plans for their customers. Because they work with finance, and they hold a lot of personal information, they are in need of security. They came to us to help them build a more secure website.

#What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
After finding out our client's software security vulnerabilities, I started planning what we should do from there. Any software that holds users' information and/or financial information has a responsibility in them to keep the information safe. It is a given that all developers should code securely. Afterall, we do not wish for anyone to suffer the consequences of information leak. You might think certain information are not a big deal, but when they get to the wrong hands, those information will come to harm you more than you think. Therefore, software security is important for not only companies but individuals as well.

#What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
At first, I feel like every part of the vulnerability assessment. Afterall, I wasn't familiar with cybersecurity until recently. But, when I learned more about it, I really felt that it helped me find the vulnerabilities quicker and helped me figure out the steps I should take to continue on.

#How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Honestly, after getting to know more about the areas of security, I feel like a lot of the layers of security are connected. Once you know where to start, you will know where to continue. When thinking about the layers of security, it is important to think about the situation and the client's needs. For instance, when they want to add a certain feature, you can think about the areas of security that feature might touch. Then, from there, you can think about what you can add that can both be a layer of security and be an enhancement to the feature and software. In the future, I will still first assess the area of security, then do a dependency check. That way, I will be able to know what areas I should prioritize first.

#What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I think the dependency check was very interesting and helpful, and I believe I will most likely use it in the future as well. Another thing that caught my interest was when we touch a bit of the HTTPS aspect. I think it leads to how a website is formed, and I have been very interested in it. I will get to websites eventually so I think this knowledge might be helpful to get me started.

#Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
Although, I do not plan to go to the field of cybersecurity, I do think more knowledge about it is always a good thing. This assignment at least shows that I have some knowledge about cybersecurity, about vulnerabilities, about understanding what the results mean. There are more awareness on security now then back then. I think in my future career, touching aspects related to security is inevitable. It is easier to understand something when you at least have some knowledge of it.
